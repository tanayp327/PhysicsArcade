# Welcome To Physics Arcade
### Written by Paaras Purohit

Paaras Purohit, Chinmay Ramamurthy, Ederick Wong, Tanay Patel, Raunak Mondal, and Qais Jamili, as the Hectic Six, are proud to present you the Physics Arcade. Not only can you use this to entertain yourself whenever you like, our algorithms for physics calculations, keyframes, and frontend to backend development are able to be implemented in classes such as CSP and CSA. 

# Deployed Project and Run Instructions

[Here](https://tanayp327.github.io/PhysicsArcade/) is the deployed website for students to view and interact. [Here]() is the deployed backend server that contains the database used by the frontend website.

To run the website online, simply go to the links replied, simple as that.

Running repositories locally is different. To run this repository locally with Jekyll, [test your site locally with](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll). To run [this](https://github.com/tanayp327/PhysicsArcadeFlask) backend server, simply run the main.py file to test your backend locally with Flask.

- **Note**: N@TM demos can be found [here](https://github.com/PaarasPurohit/apcompsciportfolio/issues/27#issue-1737167093).

# Use Cases for This Project

### Physics Game

Our physics-based projectile motion game has a lot of use cases, especially since it takes advanced physics and uses code to break it down for people to understand. Notebooks can be found [here](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcompsciportfolio/physics-ntbk) on how the code works and how it teaches people about the physics concepts being programmed.

### Snake Game

As opposed to the simulation physics game, the snake game instead can be taught with its behind-the-scenes work. Notebooks can be found [here](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcompsciportfolio/snake-ntbk) about how the code works and how to implement keyframing into other CPT's and passion projects.

### Leaderboard

This feature applies the frontend and backend development that we've been learning since the beginning of the year. Notebooks can be found [here](https://paaraspurohit.github.io/apcompsciportfolio/leaderboard-ntbk) about how the code works and how to use frontend and backend development together in student projects.

# Organization

Our scrum process was to divide up the work in the following way: Chinmay and Ederick on Projectile Motion Game, Raunak and Tanay on the Rocket Game, and Qais and Paaras doing general frontend. However, our process significantly changed when we realligned our goals to meet more with the project and Night at the Musuem Requirements, as well as being more suited to individual strengths. Chinmay and Paaras did the projectile motion game, Tanay on the rocket game, Ederick on the snake game, and Raunak and Qais on general help and frontend. Every week, on Monday, we assigned new tasks, and on Friday, we assesed which of the tasks we finished and which need to be done. All of our organization was done on Notion. We used projects for the big games and sub tasks and tasks within those projects with separate deadlines and individual member assignments. We did some of our review tickets on the Notion docs and kept individual notes and reminder on there. For our project, we have our [tasks link](https://www.notion.so/1b9d4086a73748f28826620df021d46d?v=b115f2209381410685b9f6e3f19c3a86), [projects link](https://www.notion.so/43f511807b26405ba6f2b695daea6573?v=88f8a9f50dea43e89a6b43b30db6187a), and our [docs link](https://www.notion.so/504262c940a64ec2b2b4e3b3cbe58022?v=c37399087c2847d9a20b1a3e0fabc778).
